# New Typo Graphics

## Project Description:
A couple years ago I bought a used book called, "New Typo Graphics: The New Faces of Contemporary Typography", which contained photos of contemporary posters from the late 80's to early 90's. The goal of this projects is to turn those posters into websites.
