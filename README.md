# New Typo Graphics

> A Vue.js project

## Project Description:
A couple years ago I bought a used book called, [New Typo Graphics: The New Faces of Contemporary Typography](https://www.amazon.com/New-Typo-Graphics-Contemporary-Typography/dp/4938586436), which contained photos of contemporary posters from the late 80's to early 90's. The goal of this project is to turn those posters into portfolio websites.
